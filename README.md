## Initial Attempt

So, This here is my second attempt as my initial was was mainly me just getting a feel from the framework and figuring things out, which can be found at here: https://github.com/jordanf97/movie-database

My first attempt did not work overly well and so after a fair amount of hours I decided to start completely from scratch and do a much better job.

## The Result

My second attempt is the result, being completed in a third of the time, to a much higher standard.

The project meets all criteria including only allowing authenticated users to post reviews and allowing authenticated users toedit their own reviews.

Although the backend is fully functional and to standard there is no frontend, although that can be added with little effort.

## Installation

The project uses no additional dependancies other than Laravel 5.5.29 and a MySQL server.

Simply clone the repository and you should be good to go
